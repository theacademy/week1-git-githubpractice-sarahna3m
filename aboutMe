My name is Sarah Naameh. I am 23 years old. I am a pretty good petsitter and pretty mediocre dancer currently living in Las Vegas. 

I recently graduated with a degree in Data Science focused on Sustainability. I'm reading Best of Me by David Seders and just finished re-reading the Percy Jackson series. 

I am going to get some water, I will push this then return.
